# Web-Content f√ºr die "Hallo Cordova!"-App #

<br>

This repository contains a bit of web content (two HTML files and one image) in folder [docs/](docs), which is to be used for building a mobile app for Android (and maybe also iOS) in form of a so called *Hybrid App* using *Apache Cordova*.

<br>

----

## Steps to build the app ##

<br>

**Prerequisites:** 

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed.

* [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) must be installed as [package for Node.js (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova):
  ````
  npm install -g cordova
  ````
  The option `-g` tells NPM to install the cordova globally on your computer.
<br>

Create a Cordova project:

    cordova create HalloCordova de.mide.hallocordova "Hallo Cordova"

A project structure should be created. Go to folder `www/` of this folder structure
and delete the default content in it. After this you copy the files from folder
[docs/](docs) in this repository into the `www/` folder.
Then the following commands have to be entered to build the app for
Android:

    cordova platforms add android
    cordova build

The build command should print out a message telling at which path the created installation file 
(APK file for Android) can be found.
